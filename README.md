# Task Description
---
In this task, participants search for target "T" shapes among pseudo-"L" distractors. These distractors closely resemble the targets, differing only in that the vertical bar does not intersect the horizontal bar at the midpoint—an approach that increases task difficulty without requiring prior knowledge or training (e.g., Duncan & Humphreys, 1989). In one block, participants receive AI-generated suggestions before each trial, indicating either "T is present" (green border) or "T is NOT present" (gray border). The border color during each trial reflects the AI’s suggestion. In another block, participants complete the task without any AI assistance. The simulated AI currently operates at 80% accuracy, with a 10% error rate on both target-present and target-absent trials. AI accuracy and other experimental parameters can be modified in expStructGenerator.html.
